# Robot Club TO - Placeholder Website

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the placeholder website for Robot Club TO. Its purpose is to provide essential information about the club, its mission, activities, and a way for interested individuals to apply for membership. The website is designed to be simple, modern, and responsive.

## File Structure and Purpose

Below is an overview of the main files and directories in this project:

-   **`index.html`**:
    -   The main landing page of the website.
    -   Contains sections: About Us, Club Members & Hardware, Education, Our Philosophy, Events, and Contact Us.
    -   Links to the Membership Application page.

-   **`application.html`**:
    -   The membership application form page.
    -   Collects information from prospective members.
    -   Submits data to `process_application.php`.

-   **`process_application.php`**:
    -   A PHP script that processes the data submitted from `application.html`.
    -   It performs basic validation and is designed to save application data to a text file on the server.
    -   **Important:** This script requires server-side configuration for data storage (see "Setup & Configuration" below). Email notification functionality is currently conceptual and commented out.

-   **`style.css`**:
    -   The main stylesheet for all HTML pages (`index.html`, `application.html`, and the `process_application.php` status page).
    -   Defines the visual appearance, layout, and responsiveness of the website.

-   **`script.js`**:
    -   Contains client-side JavaScript.
    -   Currently includes logic to dynamically display `logo.png` in the header if the image file exists.

-   **`logo.png`**:
    -   A placeholder image file for the club's logo. Replace this file with the actual logo (recommended dimensions around 150px width, 50px height, with a transparent background for best results). The site will display it if found.

-   **`htaccess.txt`**:
    -   A template file containing Apache web server directives.
    -   **Action Required:** This file should be **renamed to `.htaccess`** and **moved into the `_private_data` directory** on your server by the site administrator. Its purpose is to prevent direct web access to the contents of the `_private_data` directory.

-   **`_private_data/` (User-Created Server Directory)**:
    -   This directory is **not** included in the repository and **must be created manually on the server** by the site administrator, in the same directory where `process_application.php` resides (i.e., typically the web root).
    -   It is intended to store sensitive data generated by the PHP script.
    -   **`_private_data/.htaccess`** (User-Created Server File from `htaccess.txt`):
        -   Crucial for security. Denies direct web access to any files within `_private_data`.
    -   **`_private_data/submitted_applications/`** (Created by PHP script if permissions allow, or User-Created Server Directory):
        -   This subdirectory within `_private_data` is where the PHP script will attempt to save application data.
        -   **`_private_data/submitted_applications/applications.txt`** (Created by PHP script):
            -   The text file where submitted membership application details are stored. Each new application is appended to this file.

-   **`README.md`**:
    -   This file â€“ providing documentation about the project.

## Key Features

-   Responsive design for usability on desktop and mobile browsers.
-   Informational sections detailing the club's activities, philosophy, and contact details.
-   Membership application form with server-side (PHP) processing to save submissions.
-   Dynamic logo display.
-   Modern and clean aesthetic.

## Setup & Configuration (for Application Form Data Storage)

To ensure the membership application form correctly saves data:

1.  **Create `_private_data` Directory:**
    -   On your web server, in the same directory where `index.html` and `process_application.php` are located (your web root or main site directory), create a new directory named `_private_data`.
    -   Example command (run from parent of `_private_data`): `mkdir _private_data`

2.  **Set Permissions for `_private_data`:**
    -   The web server user (e.g., `www-data`, `apache`, `nobody`) needs to be able to access and potentially create subdirectories within `_private_data`.
    -   Change ownership of `_private_data` to the web server user: `sudo chown -R www-data:www-data _private_data` (replace `www-data` with your server's actual web user).
    -   Set permissions: `sudo chmod 750 _private_data` (Owner: rwx, Group: rx, Other: ---).

3.  **Place `.htaccess` in `_private_data`:**
    -   Rename the `htaccess.txt` file from this repository to `.htaccess`.
    -   Move this `.htaccess` file into the `_private_data` directory you just created.
    -   Path: `_private_data/.htaccess`
    -   Content (should be `Require all denied` or `Deny from all` for older Apache):
        ```apache
        # Deny all direct web access to this directory and its contents
        Require all denied
        ```
    -   This step is **critical** for preventing direct web access to application data if using an Apache server. If using Nginx or another server, implement equivalent access restriction rules in your server's configuration.

4.  **`submitted_applications` Directory and `applications.txt` File:**
    -   The `process_application.php` script will attempt to create the `_private_data/submitted_applications/` directory if it doesn't exist, with `0750` permissions.
    -   It will then attempt to create/append to `_private_data/submitted_applications/applications.txt`.
    -   For this to work, the `_private_data` directory must be writable by the web server user (covered by step 2).
    -   If you find the script cannot create the subdirectory or file, you may need to manually create `_private_data/submitted_applications/` and ensure it's also owned and writable by the web server user (e.g., `sudo mkdir _private_data/submitted_applications`, `sudo chown www-data:www-data _private_data/submitted_applications`, `sudo chmod 750 _private_data/submitted_applications`).

5.  **Email Notifications (Conceptual):**
    -   The email notification feature in `process_application.php` is commented out. To enable it, you would need a configured mail server (SMTP) on your web server, and potentially use a more robust PHP email library like PHPMailer for reliability.

## Future Improvements & Suggestions

-   **Robust Email Notifications:** Implement reliable email notifications to an admin address upon new membership application submissions.
-   **Database Integration:** Replace the text file storage for applications with a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB) for more robust storage, querying, and management.
-   **Admin Interface:** Develop a secure admin area to view, manage, and approve/reject membership applications.
-   **Blog/News Section:** Add a section for club news, articles, and updates.
-   **Events Calendar:** Implement a dynamic calendar for upcoming events, workshops, and meetups.
-   **Photo/Video Gallery:** Create a gallery to showcase club projects, robots, and event photos/videos.
-   **Enhanced Interactivity:** Incorporate more JavaScript-driven interactive elements or animations.
-   **Member Login Area:** If the club grows to require it, a members-only section could provide access to exclusive resources or forums.
-   **Theming/Customization:** Allow for easier theming or customization of the website's appearance.
-   **Accessibility Audit:** Perform an accessibility audit (WCAG) and implement improvements.
