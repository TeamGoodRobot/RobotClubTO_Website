            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Robot Club TO! We are a passionate group of innovators, builders, and thinkers dedicated to exploring the frontiers of robotics. Robot Club TO is a registered Ontario Not For Profit organization.</p>
            <p>Our official mailing address is on Dovercourt Road in Downtown Toronto, nestled in the vibrant Queen Street West neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>We are proud friends of InterAccess (32 Lisgar St, Toronto, ON M6J 0C7), an amazing organization at the intersection of art and technology. We often meet, work on our robots, and host robotics events at their studio. You'll frequently find our robot dogs, Joule (and sometimes Perl), at the InterAccess space. We look forward to hosting more workshops and collaborative sessions there in the future.</p>

            <h2>Club Members & Hardware</h2>
            <p>Meet some of our most active members: Joule and Perl! These two advanced Unitree quadruped robots (often called 'robot dogs') are at the forefront of our explorations. We're also fortunate to have access to a variety of other robotics components, development platforms, and specialized hardware that support our diverse projects and learning initiatives.</p>

        <section id="education">
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>We believe in sharing knowledge and empowering the next generation of roboticists. Our educational programs and workshops cover a wide range of topics, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Robot Operating System (ROS)</li>
                <li>Advanced Motor Control Techniques</li>
                <li>Field-Oriented Control (FOC) for Motors</li>
                <li>Sensor Integration and Data Processing</li>
                <li>Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) in Robotics</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="philosophy">
            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Robotics is at a significant turning point. Many of the classical challenges in robotics, such as stable locomotion and basic manipulation, are becoming solved problems. We are now witnessing the emergence of incredibly impressive hardware, like high-performance motors utilizing Field-Oriented Control (FOC), that offer unprecedented capabilities.</p>
            <p>Our philosophy is to leverage these advancements and focus on the next frontier: intelligence. We believe that Large Language Models (LLMs) are key to endowing robots with sophisticated thinking, planning, and perception capabilities. By integrating cutting-edge AI with advanced hardware, we aim to create truly autonomous and intelligent robotic systems.</p>
            <p>Our mission is: "To advance the understanding and application of robotics through education, collaborative projects, and knowledge sharing within the community; to foster creative innovation in robotics, promoting symbiotic relationships between humans and intelligent systems; and to provide a platform for enthusiasts, professionals, and the public to engage with robotics technology."</p>
